T I T L E: Authorship patterns in Africa's groundwater literature: Indications for helicopter research?

A B S T R A C T

Groundwater plays an essential role in Africa and corresponding research is vital to resource management andlong-term planning. However, the level of research output and the mode of international research collaborationon the continent have been questioned.
In particular, cases of “helicopter research” have been reported. The termimplies that scientists from wealthy nations do research in lower-income countries without involving localcollaborators.To investigate the phenomenon in a groundwater context, we
performed a bibliometric study by extractingand analyzing (meta)data from Clarivate’s Web of Science database for the time period 1991–2020. Here, weparticularly focused on authors and their affiliations.The analysis showed that there is a pronounced
intra-continental imbalance and that much of the groundwaterresearch output in Africa is produced by Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa, Tunisia, and Morocco – larger countrieswith a relatively high Gross Domestic Product. These nations apparently “own” their research,
i.e., papers aboutgroundwater in these countries include local (co-)authors (affiliation in the concerned country), or at least au-thors with an African affiliation. However, this does not apply to a number of other African countries, implyingthat local
scientists do not spearhead corresponding studies which points towards helicopter research.To foster effective groundwater research and counteract the above-mentioned development, various playershave to contribute, including local governments, funding 
organizations, individual researchers, but also journals
